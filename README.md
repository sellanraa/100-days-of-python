# 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp (Udemy)

## Explanation
- Just recently laid off so returning and restarting the Udemy Python course from the start
- I really enjoyed this course from a few years ago before I lost momentum due to beginning a local coding academy where I had to shift gears to HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
- I'm in a very different spot than when I started this course a couple years ago, so excited to return in a more confident place
